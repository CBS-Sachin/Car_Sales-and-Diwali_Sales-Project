This project involves two separate data analysis modules:
i)Car Sales Analysis
ii)Diwali Sales Analysis
Both datasets are analyzed using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and other libraries to clean, preprocess, visualize, and model the data, as well as detect outliers and perform exploratory analysis.
